			<h3>
				Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)<br>
				Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)<br>
			 	He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na<br>
			    All of my heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
				There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)<br>
				Havana, ooh na-na
			</h3>
			<!--Verse nr 1-->
			<h4>
				[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]<br>
				He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"<br>
				(When he came in the room)<br>
				He said thereâ€™s a lot of girls I can do with<br>
				(But I can't without you)<br>
				I'm doin' forever in a minute<br>
				(That summer night in June)<br>
				And papa says he got malo in him<br>
				He got me feelin' like<br>
			</h4>
			<h4>
				[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]<br>
				Oooh-oooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him<br>
				I loved him when I left him<br>
				Got me feelin' like<br>
				Oooh-oooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him<br>
				I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na<br>
			</h4>
			<h4>
				[Chorus: Camila Cabello and Pharrell Williams]<br>
				Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)<br>
				Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)<br>
				He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)<br>
				All of my heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
				My heart is in Havana<br>
				Havana, ooh na-na<br>
